      <p>Hi! My name is Johan. I'm Swedish. Born and raised there. Before I came to the US 12 years ago, I lived in Switzerland for 10 years. I have lived in Marin county since I came to the US and worked for Autodesk, a design software company. </p>

      <p>I like mountain biking, and getting around on bikes in general. I also like sailing. I have a sailboat with my sister and we go out for a spin on the bay with a bunch of friends almost every weekend. </p>

      <p>My girlfriend and I are renting a house in Mill Valley. She likes biking too. Her two teenagers are also living with us. And Buzz, our 13 year old blind yellow lab. He is pretty slow and a bit stubborn, but still very cute.</p>

      <p>Throughout my career I have done lots of scripting in Perl and Python. I actually worked as a web developer for four years. It was the most fun job I've had in my career. That was 14 years ago in Switzerland. A lot has changed since then. We almost didn't use any CSS, and we had to use tables for page layout (a big no-no these days). All the dynamic stuff was done by Perl on the server and there were still no frameworks. JavaScript was only used for simple form validation. I'm now looking forward to learn web development the way it's done today (and will be done tomorrow). </p>
