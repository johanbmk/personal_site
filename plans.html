      <p>I'm exited to get started on the Web Development Immersive, really looking forward to spending months learning new and interesting stuff. &mdash; And meeting new fellow students and teachers.</p>

      <p>I have been in the workforce for a while and I'm in the second half of my work life now. I was laid off from my previous job as a localization engineering manager, and thought that even if it is uncomfortable to lose my job, it's also a great opportunity to choose again what it is I'm passionate about. I have thought and said many times that the most fun and creative job I've had in the past was web development.</p>

      <p>But it does not feel like I'm "going back" to an old job. It is to learn something new but still familiar, and in my case almost guaranteed to be fun. Web development is more relevant than ever. Stuff that used to be for local machine install and use is now web applications. (My previous employer Autodesk now makes their graphics-intense CAD systems as web apps).</p>

      <p>I love the way even a simple web application is a networking system, &mdash; that some stuff is done by the browswer and some by the server. I want to learn how to design and implement modern complete web applications. Splitting up complex stuff into microservices is also something I'd like to learn more about. &mdash; Node.js?</p>

      <p>After Galvanize, I'm hoping to find a work place with an engaged, kind and collaborative environment. I'm not yet sure it has to be a company whose product is a web app. It may be that the company's product is something completely different, like solar panels or beer, and what I will do is work on web apps around the internal, external and partners business processes.</p>

      <p>For further education goals. Well, it depends a bit on what I learn during WDI, but maybe UX design as a complement. It's a bit of a weak area for me. It depends where I end up. Many work places already have dedicated UX designers to work with as a team. Another idea is to learn some Data Science. Perhaps Machine Learning.</p>

      <p>I'm really looking forward to learning all the aspects of the full stack web development. Here is an animated gif to show how I feel about it: </p>
